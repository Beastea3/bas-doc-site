# Ownership & Access Control

In Web3, two crucial functionalities must be implemented to address users' personal data: 1) returning data ownership to users and 2) assetization of user data. To achieve these transformative goals, two requirements are essential for data in Web3:

- User holds Ownership of Data: Clarifying ownership of data is a pivotal feature of Web3. Only when users regain ownership of their data can privacy, data security, and the rightful earnings as data owners be guaranteed.
- Contract-Controlled Data Access: To facilitate the assetization of user data, it is necessary for users to entrust their data to smart contracts, allowing the contracts to handle assetization and subsequent trading processes. It is crucial to note that, due to gas fees and the public nature of the blockchain, contracts should handle only the access control permissions of the data.

Users can use the BNB Attestation Service (BAS) to generate off-chain attestations and store them in Greenfield to reclaim data ownership. Simultaneously, users can mirror attestations to the BNB Chain, issue access permissions as NFTs, and trade these permissions on the blockchain.

## Example: Decentralized LinkedIn

Users can create off-chain attestations for their introductions, contact information, and resumes and publish them on the platform. At this point, users can:

- Set read permissions for users who meet certain conditions, such as:
  - Owning platform membership NFTs
  - Being verified by certain companies
  - Belonging to specific DAOs or meeting asset thresholds
- Set charging standards, requiring a certain amount of tokens for access permissions
- Sell access permissions to the platform, allowing the platform to resell them

When users create off-chain attestations and store them in Greenfield, this not only introduces Web2 data to Web3 but also completes the process of assetizing user data. It signifies the transition of ownership of productive materials in the digital era and enables the free circulation of these productive materials.
